    description: `ClutterMine is a mass garage sale
        business idea where people who want to get rid of, and maybe make a
        little money from items taking up room in their homes, but who lack
        the time/energy to go about posting ads, or even the means to take
        their "junk" to the dump, can put there items on consigment with
        ClutterMine who will do the rest.
        <br /><br />
        ClutterMine will take the "clutter" to
        thier storefront where these items will sit for sale. As soon as the
        items are sold, the customer will recieve the consigment percentage
        that was agreed upon during the onboarding process.
        <br /><br />
        The system behind this idea is being built with Node on the backend, 
        and React Native on the front end. The database is MySQL.`,
