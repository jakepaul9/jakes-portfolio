        business idea where people who want to get rid of, and maybe make a
        little money from items taking up room in their homes, but who lack
        the time/energy to go about posting ads, or even the means to take
        their "junk" to the dump, can put there items on consigment with
        <span className='emph'>ClutterMine</span> who will do the rest.
        <br /><br />
        <span className='emph'>ClutterMine</span> will take the "clutter" to
        thier storefront where these items will sit for sale. As soon as the
        items are sold, the customer will recieve the consigment percentage
        that was agreed upon during the onboarding process.`,
