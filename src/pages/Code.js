          The endless potential to solve problems with a programming language is
          very exciting to me. I enjoy thinking of ways to improve processes at
          work, or make things easier in my personal life by developing an app
          or writing a snippet of code. I enjoy using modern Javascript
          frameworks including those in the MERN stack, and also good ol' C++.
          I've included projects below I've been/am working on either for
          school, or those I'm developing on the side.
